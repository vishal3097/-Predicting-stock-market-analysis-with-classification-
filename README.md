# -Predicting-stock-market-analysis-with-classification-
I have worked to achieve maximum accuracy of predicting stock market price (ie rise/fall/neutral) with the help of K-NN, Random Forest & Multinomial Logistic Regression algorithms.
Steps which are included for stock market analysis
 1. Loading all required packages
 2. Loading dataset
 3. Split the data in training and testing with random selection
 4. Train model using following methods
 a) Random Forest
 b) K-NN model
 c) Multinomial Logistic Regression
 5. Record times
 6. Draw confusion matrix
 7. Predict on training dataset to see maximum prediction working
 8. Predict on testing dataset to see accuracy of model
